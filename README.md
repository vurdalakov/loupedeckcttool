# Loupedeck CT Tool

### Important

This tool solves the "slow Internet" problem that was caused by the [Ethernet over USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_USB) way Loupedeck software was communicating with CT/Live devices. In the recent software versions (4.3 or later) and firmware versions (0.2.5 or later) Loupedeck moved to [CDC over USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_communications_device_class) way, and that eliminated the "slow Internet" problem.

If you experince the "slow Internet" behavior, I recommend you to update Loupedeck software to the latest version available and then [update your Loupedeck CT and Loupedeck Live devices with the latest firmware](https://support.loupedeck.com/firmware). This tool is then not needed anymore.

### Overview
